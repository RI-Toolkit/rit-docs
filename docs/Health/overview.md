This module will produce transition probabilities for health state and functional disability models for a specified initial age (from 50 to 65 up to age 110) and health state based on the calibrated parametrization of models. Models to include static models, improvement trends in transition rates and stochastic transition rates (latent factor). 

Models will include functional disability based on:

- Various ADLâ€™s (2+, 3+, cognitive decline) with recovery
- Joint health status 
- Disability states based on core activities for Australian applications

Output will include:

- Probability transition matrices for different starting ages derived from transition rates, with trends
- Expected transition rates and simulated future transition rates for stochastic simulations

Models will be included to forecast the Australian prevalence of disabled populations based on functional disability models.
