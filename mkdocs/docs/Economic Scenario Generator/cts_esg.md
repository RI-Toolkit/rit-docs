# Continuous-Time Generator

The continuous-time economic scenario generator simulates the trajectories of: 

(1) Australia zero-coupon bond rates maturing every quarter from 3 months up to 10 years, i.e., 0.25 years, 0.5 years, 0.75 years, ..., 10 years, 

(2) NSW home value index,  

(3) S&P/ASX200 price. 

The zero-coupon bond term structure is fitted using the arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel model, while NSW home value index and S&P/ASX200 price are assumed to be Geometric Brownian Motions that are correlated with the zero-coupon bond rates. 

The independent-factor model assumes that the level, slope, and curvature of the zero-coupon bond term structure are mutually independent, while the correlated-factor model assumes dependence among them. Simulations generated by the correlated-factor models are more variable since more parameters are involved. 

The results are still depicted with the same simulation frequency options as the discrete case, but the calculations are based in continuous time.

**get_afns_simulation(num_years = 5, num_paths = 10, frequency = 'month', type = 'independent', model = 'interest_rate')**

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Paramters:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; num_years : numeric

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *integer denoting number of years to forecast from 2021-06-01*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; num_paths : numeric

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *integer denoting the number of simulation paths*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency : character

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *'year', 'quarter' or 'month' denoting the simulation frequency*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; type : character

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *'independent' or 'correlated' denoting whether the latent factors are independent of each other*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; model : character

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *'interest_rate' or 'interest_house_stock' denoting the output variables*

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Returns:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of 40 dataframes containing simulated interest rates with maturities from 1 quarter up to 10 years, or 42 dataframes containing interest rate structure, NSW house value index, S&P/ASX200 closing prices if model is set to be interest_house_stock.  

&nbsp;&nbsp; **Usage:**

```r
# simulate 10 years of data 
sim <- get_afns_simulation(num_years = 10, num_paths = 10000, frequency = 'year', type = 'independent', model = 'interest_house_stock')

# suppose we wish to look at the 3-month zero-coupon bond rates
sim$maturity_1qtrs

# suppose we wish to look at the 5-year zero-coupon bond rates
sim$maturity_20qtrs

# NSW house value index 
sim$house_index

# S&P/ASX200 closing price 
sim$stock_price 
```
