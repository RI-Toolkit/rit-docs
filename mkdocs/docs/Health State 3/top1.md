# Cox Hazard Model 

## General Principle

The Cox Proportional Hazards Model is used to estimate the hazard rate or transition
intensity for different transitions. The general form of the transition intensities for 
an individual $k$ and transition type $s$ is:

$$\lambda_{k, s}(t) = \text{exp}(\mathbf{\beta})$$
